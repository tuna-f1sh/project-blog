## /[A-z]+ware Engineer/g

A mechanical engineering graduate from the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk), I also developed into an international mountain biker during my studies. Initially choosing to follow a career in cycling, I still had the _maker_ mindset that lead me to pursue an engineering degree. I originally created this website to document projects that I complete around my racing and training, in order to keep my brain as active as my legs!

The blog has now been going since 2012 and is a history of my development as an engineer; the old posts are not a true reflection of my current skill level. I hope to continue updating this blog with personal projects and engineering tidbits throughout my life.

For my engineering career, see [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwilliamwhittington/) or contact me for an up to date CV. A brief summary:

* Currently work at Specialized Europe in Turbo innovation; CAN bus, BLE, embedded, doing cool things...[https://youtu.be/R2aE-Zq6S04?t=1138](https://youtu.be/R2aE-Zq6S04?t=1138), [department visit](https://ebike-mtb.com/en/specialized-factory-visit/).
* Have [contributed to Linux](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=grep&q=whittington).
* Main interest is embedded but am a generalist, hence `/[A-z]+ware Engineer/g`. One can see examples of that on this blog.
* Worked as a consultant for new product development teams are well known public companies.
* Consulted on venture capital product development projects.

_JBR Engineering Research Limited_ is the name of my engineering company, which I sell my products under and provide consulting. See the landing page here: [JBR Engineering Website](https://www.jbrengineering.co.uk) and [Shop](https://shop.jbrengineering.co.uk).
