## /[A-z]+ware Engineer/g

A mechanical engineering graduate from the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk), I also developed into an international mountain biker during my studies. Initially choosing to follow a career in cycling, I still had the _maker_ mindset that lead me to pursue an engineering degree. I originally created this website to document projects that I complete around my racing and training, in order to keep my brain as active as my legs!

The blog has now been going since 2012 and is a history of my development as an engineer; the old posts are not a true reflection of my current skill level. I hope to continue updating this blog with personal projects and engineering tidbits throughout my life.

For my engineering career, see [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwilliamwhittington/) or contact me for an up to date CV.

_JBR Engineering Research Limited_ is the name of my engineering company, which I sell my products under and provide consulting. See the landing page here: [JBR Engineering Website](https://www.jbrengineering.co.uk) and [Shop](https://shop.jbrengineering.co.uk).
