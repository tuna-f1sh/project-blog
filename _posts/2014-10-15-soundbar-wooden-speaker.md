I felt that the [battery powered Bluetooth speaker](/2014/05/laser-cut-battery-powered-bluetooth-speaker/ "Laser Cut Battery Powered Bluetooth Speaker") I made could be improved with more colour! Taking a leaf from the VU meters on amplifiers of the 80s, I decided it would be neat to sandwich clear acrylic between the plywood layers, each with an integrated LED that would form a full body amplitude meter.

Having a look around, I found a IC made by Texas instruments that did the VU meter job for me: [the LM3915](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm3915.pdf). Below is a photo series showing the construction and completed unit. I designed this version as a _soundbar_ to sit below my monitors at work, so it doesn&#8217;t have a battery or Bluetooth, making the wiring easier inside and a slimmer unit. For this one I also used an Oak stain rather than a clear stain on the ply and filled the text with black acrylic, which looks much better I think.
