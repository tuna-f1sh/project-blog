I wanted a place to mount my phone, to use for navigation, a bluetooth music player and handsfree in my Audi TT. The sloping windscreen makes it impossible to mount anything and the curved dashboard makes it difficult there too. Plus I wanted something neat, not a naff eBay mount and also an excuse to toy around in SketchUp.

I first came up with an aluminium plate, to slot between the vent body and dashboard (you can slide the vent pods out) that I would mount a 3D printed gripper to. The problem with this was getting the aluminium cut. I then thought about 3D printing as one piece but after recently being inducted to use the laser cutter at the Bristol Hackspace, I was inspired to use that instead.<figure id="attachment_329" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-329" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The final design uses 3mm Walnut, which I&#8217;ve prototyped in Plywood. It&#8217;s a car with a lot of unique design and I think the slotted wooden mount compliments this. I&#8217;ll probably print it at some point too, just to see how it looks and also refined the wood one a bit more. I&#8217;ve considered fully enclosing the vents but think it looks to bulky.<figure id="attachment_331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-331" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

# UPDATE &#8211; 01/15

My first solution worked well enough but sliding the phone in and out wasn&#8217;t exactly quick and had to be with care. The other problem was the it only worked with the iPhone 4.

Having upgraded my phone, rather than update the _claw_ dimensions &#8211; limiting it to one phone again &#8211; I decided that a new grip design was in order. I wanted something that could scale to any phone, whilst still holding it securely, and to still be simple to make.

I came up with opposing claws, Â with the top slotted into slightly wider slots that allow them to move laterally. To provide a force to keep the claws together and hold the phone in place, I looped a couple of o-rings between the claws.

My first attempt, the grip was good but not great enough to hold the phone in a moving car. By using heatshrink on the claw tips, the grip was improved but still not great. My final version has a chamfered edge to the surface touching the phone edges _pinching_ the phone in place.
