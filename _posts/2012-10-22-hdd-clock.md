With a cupboard full of old hard drives and some spare time, I recently set about making a persistence of vision clock. Using the platter of a hard disk, a slot is cut to allow backlighting to be emit. When the disk is spinning at 5400rpm+ and backlight constant, the disk appears opaque, as the slit is &#8216;refreshing&#8217; each point of the revolution faster than our eyes. The trick is to measure the revolution time then flash or change the backlight colour at a fraction of this revolution time at the same point each revolution, in order to create a light segment. For example, flashing the light at a frequency twelve times the disk frequency in phase with the disk will create 12 light segments:

$latex f\_{light}=12.f\_{disk}=\frac{12}{p_{disk}}$

Expanding on this, one can create a light based clock, which takes some getting one&#8217;s head around on first sight!

## Donor Parts

It isn&#8217;t just hard drives that have to suffer for this: in order to detect the speed of the disk, I used an IR LED/photodiode break detector, salvaged from a floppy drive. The component is a nice horseshoe arrangement, used to detect whether a floppy is in the drive and that saves having to construct something myself. A bit of reverse engineering with a multimeter and I had the pin arrangement:<figure id="attachment_139" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

## Construction

Taking apart the Maxtor, there where two platters. I took both off with the read arm, cut a slit in one and threw away the other. Having gutted the drive, I stuck 5050 RGB LED strip around the parameter of the area the platters sit. The strip is the perfect height of the casing but I required a few washers to raise the disk above the LEDs. It&#8217;s a very tight fit and I&#8217;m sure the guys who precision designed these things would cry to look at it!<figure id="attachment_147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

It&#8217;s surprisingly well held.</figcaption></figure> 

With the disk remounted, I positioned the IR sensor so that the disk spins through it. A splodge of hot glue and it&#8217;s held in place nicely. Having installed custom washers and cutting the disk, it wasn&#8217;t mounting true. A bit of tweaking of bolt tightness and I got it running straight enough to clear the IR sensor and registering a HIGH signal each revolution.

## Programming

The stage I&#8217;m currently at and the main reason I built the thing; it presents an interesting programming challenge and a chance to learn about timer interrupts.

So far I&#8217;ve got code that can measure the revolution time using a hardware interrupt triggered by the IR sensor. Using a fraction of that time to blick a colour creates a segmented pattern but not steady or what I would expect. The problem I think being that the blink can be interrupted by the IR sensor, throwing the timing out. I&#8217;ve toyed with using a timer1 interrupt set to a fraction of the revolution but then the hardware interrupt gets&#8230;interrupted!

Turning to [others code](http://www.instructables.com/id/Hard-Drive-Persistence-of-Vision-HDPOV/), I can check the thing is working properly and get some inspiration. Here&#8217;s a demo of it so far. It includes a clock python script that uses [pySerial](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/) to drive the Arduino via serial. Pretty neat and I can see myself finally learning Python for this:
