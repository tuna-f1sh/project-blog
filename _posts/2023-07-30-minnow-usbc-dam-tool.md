Minnow is a tool for using DAM (Debug Accessory Mode), providing an interface to SWD or JTAG and/or UART from the device. It expands upon [this concept](https://github.com/BitterAndReal/SWD-over-USB-C) to include a USB-UART and some utility for use within test rigs. It could be considered SWD over DAM with a sprinkling of [USB cereal](https://github.com/oxda/usb-cereal) - unlike usb-cereal it does not use the Chomebook UART mapping in favour of maintaining USB-C rotational symmetry.

* Enables and interfaces USB DAM configured in image below; Full SWD or JTAG over USB-C.
* Provides board designer the option of using RX+ for NRST/RXD and RX- for SWO/TXD - either single-wire trace communication (RTT) or UART.
* Four configurable GPIO on FT230 for test rig control of UUT: power enable; RX pin control; reset.
* TagConnect TC2030 and ARM 10-pin header to debugger.
* USB pass-through or FT230 USB UART to device.
* VTARGET reference from device or external.
* Maintains USB-C rotational symmetry.

That's the intro for the [README.md](https://github.com/tuna-f1sh/minnow). I'll expand a bit more on why I made the device here. The debugger over SWD/JTAG is a pre-requisite when developing any custom embedded hardware, and is often required for provisioning said hardware (in volumes below pre-programmed microcontrollers). When designing a PCB, there is often a trade off between ease of debugger attachment and land. I'm a fan of the [TagConnect](https://www.tag-connect.com/) system but even that is quite big and really should be reserved for out of form, initial dev boards. Additionally, once the device is _embedded_ the debugger header often cannot be accessed.

Most devices have a USB-C interface, which supports USB 3.1+ [Alternate Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C#Alternate_Mode_2). The Alternate Mode lines provide 5 lines (2 differential pairs and 1 signal), which provide a designer up-to 10 additional IO (not used as differential and rotational asymmetry). These pins are used by USB-C [interface protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C#Alternate_Mode_partner_specifications) such as DisplayPort, Thunderbolt and HDMI.

The USB specification even includes one for debugging; [DAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C#Debug_Accessory_Mode) - what we are talking about here. It's up-to the designer how to implement it, the specification only covers how to enter DAM. Since the port is normally externally accessible and already taking up board area it's a nice solution to solve the issues mentioned in the paragraph above.

Whilst it may not be ideal for the highest security devices - exposing an external interface to debuggers - the SWD/JTAG/readback could still be disabled with fuses in production firmwares (as it should be).

[Minnow](https://github.com/tuna-f1sh/minnow) implements DAM by defining the [SWD and JTAG](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101636/0100/Debug-and-Trace/JTAG-SWD-Interface) interface over the Alternate Mode differential pairs and VTARGET over SBUS. Since there are four SWD lines and one for VTARGET, USB-C rotational symmetry is maintained üôè. The Minnow hardware does the job of pulling the CC lines high with the pull-ups defined in the USB specification, so when connected to a supported target SWD is exposed on the 10-pin ARM and TagConnect headers.

It does this in additional to passing the standard USB 2.0 differential pairs to the host; SWD can be used at the same time as USB communication.

I also added the option of using the _extra_ SWD lines (NRST and TRACE, not required for programming/debug) for UART. This means the target device can forward a UART over USB-C for provisioning rather than RTT. For this, Minnow includes a FTDI FT230X USB-UART adaptor so no additional tools are required.

The on-board FT230X's GPIO can also be used to control power to the target device, reset the device or control something else.

__Some additional circuitry is required on the target device to implement DAM as per the USB specification; it could be reduced if not concerned about meeting the spec. The additional parts are not any bigger than most other debugging headers however, with the benefit of not requiring a bespoke plug - just a USB-C.__
