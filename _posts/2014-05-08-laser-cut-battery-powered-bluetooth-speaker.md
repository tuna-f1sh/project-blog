I wanted to create a special birthday present for my girlfriend, whom had no speaker system. I decided a battery powered Bluetooth speaker would be neat, and having just learnt use of the laser cutter I came up with a layered design.

<figure id="attachment_349" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-349" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The internals consist of a 2x15W RMS digital amp, 2x15W 80 cones, a Bluetooth module, 1800mAh NiMH battery and a basic fast charger &#8211; plus a few voltage regulators to bring everything together. It&#8217;s all wired so that you can charge while plugged in and still play, and turn the Bluetooth on and off. Finally it&#8217;s all insulated with sheep&#8217;s wool I had left from doing my van. I found the insulation helped reduce reverberation (probably due to the thin layers) that muddied the mid-ranges. One thing I like about it is that the front and back can be easily changed: the front grill pattern to change the look and the rear could be tuned to include a bass port for better bass response.

I fairly pleased with the result and might start producing them if there is enough interest.
