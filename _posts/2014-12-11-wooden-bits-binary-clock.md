![Wooden Bits Gif](http://i.imgur.com/n8bL5TM.gif)

I&#8217;ve been meaning to make a binary wall clock for a while and to also try out [kerf bending](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=kerf+bend&espv=2&biw=1920&bih=1139&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=tnSIVKGhH8O9Ue2MgOgC&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ) with the laser cutter. What put me off creating kerf bends before I found [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.com), was the manual creation of all the lines in the right places. It&#8217;s the kind of repetitive, uniform task computers were made to do.

# Design

Above was what I wanted to create; a square matrix formed from one length of plywood, with the curves creating some organic interest to an otherwise boring shape. I opened Vim and started away in lines of _OpenSCAD_.

I ended up creating script that could create a one-piece design but would also split the length into divisions. I did this because the length was too big for the cutter bed. For the initial build, each (of four rows) row is separate and then they are all glued together. Â If I make another I&#8217;ll add a _dovetail_ so that each section can be joined, it&#8217;s more complicated because you have to alternate the teeth/dents on the middle male components.

# Make

There was some tweaking involved of the kerf spacing to get it strong yet bendable but overall it was a relatively pain-free construction.

# Electronics

<del datetime="2016-10-30T08:37:03+00:00">The controller is an Arduino Micro with a <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/DS1307-I2C-RTC-AT24C32-Real-Time-Clock-Board-Module-Arduino-ARM-PIC-UK-SELLER-/400851057029?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_3&hash=item5d5495b985">DS1307 RTC module</a> and the W2812B LED chain connected to pin 6.</del>

**UPDATE** I have now created a custom PCB, the size of a single cell.

# Code

### Features

  * Version for Arduino/Attiny328 and Raspberry Pi.
  * Scales to any size WS2812 matrix.
  * Ability to rotate display.
  * Ability to set second indicator pulsing.
  * Quarter hour indicator fills n/quarter rows of the display blue (n is the  
    quarter multiple).
  * Full rainbow and midday and midnight.
  * `setMatrix` for sending any binary size to display; not just time.
  * `initMatrixMap` for creating lookup map of display.

I had a quick Google for Arduino binary clock code and the top hits weren&#8217;t all the elegant. They employed a brute force method of creating `if`/`else` for each digit possibility and resulting GPIO set. Due to this they couldn&#8217;t scale beyond their original project.

My method is to create an 4 element array of binary nibbles, one for each clock digit. 13:40 would look like this:

```assci
{0}{1}{2}{3}
[0][0][0][0]
[0][0][1][0]
[0][1][0][0]
[1][1][0][0]
```

One can then loop through each binary nyble and use a bit-shift on each bit to set the pixel on or off (there are twice as many `for` to allow the clock to scale and fill any size matrix):

```c
uint8_t x; // row inc.
  uint8_t y; // height inc.
  uint8_t i; // binary set matrix
  uint8_t yy; // full column inc.
  uint8_t xx = 0; // full row inc.

  for ( i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    for (yy = 0;yy < PIXEL_COLUMN; yy += height) {
      for (y = 0; y < height; y++) {
        for (x = 0; x < {
          if (x == 0 && y == 0) {
            setPixel(pixelMap[xx+x][yy+y],((bMatrix[i] >> yy/height) & 1),color1);
          } else {
            setPixel(pixelMap[xx+x][yy+y],((bMatrix[i] >> yy/height) & 1),color2);
          }
        }
      }
    }
    xx += 
```

Wiring an LED matrix creates a _snakes and ladders_ index, which is hard to reference without a map. The pixelMap is created like so:

```c
uint8_t i; // row inc.
  uint8_t j; // column inc.
  uint16_t pixel_inc; // pixel number inc.

  /* What we're trying to draw (64 pixel unicorn hat grid) */
  /* It's a snakes and ladders type arrangement for any matrix */
  /*   {7 ,6 ,5 ,4 ,3 ,2 ,1 ,0 },*/
  /*   {8 ,9 ,10,11,12,13,14,15},*/
  /*   {23,22,21,20,19,18,17,16},*/
  /*   {24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31},*/
  /*   {39,38,37,36,35,34,33,32},*/
  /*   {40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47},*/
  /*   {55,54,53,52,51,50,49,48},*/
  /*   {56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63}*/
  /* */

  // The cord either starts at 0 or length of row depending on whether it's rotated
  pixel_inc = rotate ? PIXEL_ROW : 0;

  for (i = 0; i < PIXEL_COLUMN; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < PIXEL_ROW; j++) {
      // We either increment or decrement depending on column due to snakes and ladders arrangement
      if (rotate) {
        pixelMap[i][j] = (i % 2 == 0) ? --pixel_inc : ++pixel_inc;
      } else {
        pixelMap[j][i] = (i % 2 != 0) ? pixel_inc-- : pixel_inc++;
      }
    }
    pixel_inc += PIXEL_ROW;
    (i % 2 == 0) ? pixel_inc-- : pixel_inc++;
  }
```

The binary nybles are created using bit-wise comparison on the decimal digit. For the power of ten times, one has to do a extract each digit using a mix of flooring and division/multiplication:

```c
// convert the time into 4 nybles for each column of matrix
  if (hour >= 0 && hour < 10) { bTime[1] = hour | 0b0000; bTime[0] = 0b0000; // 2nd digit still needs clearing } else { bTime[1] = (uint8_t) (hour-(floor(hour/10)*10)) | 0b0000; bTime[0] = (uint8_t) (floor(hour-(hour-floor(hour)))/10) | 0b0000; } if (minute >= 0 && minute < 10) {
    bTime[3] = minute | 0b0000;
    bTime[2] = 0b0000; // 2nd digit still needs clearing
  } else {
    bTime[3] = (uint8_t) (minute-(floor(minute/10)*10)) | 0b0000;
    bTime[2] = (uint8_t) (floor(minute-(minute-floor(minute)))/10) | 0b0000;
  }
```

# Raspberry Pi

After I&#8217;d completed it I felt like porting it to the Raspberry Pi and [Pimoroni&#8217;s Unicorn Hat](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-hat). I was already using the [Arduino Make](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) Makefile so had a header with declarations unlike most Arduino projects. The main changes were the GPIO functions to actually set the matrix. Thankfully a [WS2812 Driver](https://github.com/626Pilot/RaspberryPi-NeoPixel-WS2812) exists with the same functions as the _NeoPixel_ library, so the task wasn&#8217;t all the difficult. Rather than referencing the _pixels_ object, the functions are directly called since it&#8217;s straight C.

Because the _Unicorn Hat_ is an 8&#215;8 (twice the size of mine), it allowed me to ensure the code scaled to any size matrix and the process created improvements that I carried back to the Arduino code.

# Result

</div>

I&#8217;m pleased with the result. The clock is stable and has so far been running for days without issue. It&#8217;s a Christmas present for the lab but my parents want one too so I&#8217;ll make another. The next one will be one piece with _dovetail_ joints between sections amongst other points I&#8217;d like to improve on:

  * Clock set routine invoked from tactile switch or even better a hand wave across one of the cells (the one with the controller in).
  * Alarm routine that can be remotely set via phone app &#8211; I&#8217;d use a bluetooth module for this.

_UPDATE:_ [I&#8217;ve added both!](/2015/05/setting-wooden-bits-via-ble-and-esp8266/)
