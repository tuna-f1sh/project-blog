Having seen the [Bar Fly](http://road.cc/content/news/59922-above-category-bike-shops-bar-fly-computer-mount-now-available-uk) I became set on a &#8216;SRM style&#8217; mounting for my Garmin. I wasn&#8217;t set to pay £40 for one however.

Doing my research, it turned out the Bar Fly was inspired by a thread on a bike forum ([a Triathlon forum](http://forum.slowtwitch.com/forum/Slowtwitch_Forums_C1/Triathlon_Forum_F1/Garmin_500_custom_mount_P3690537/) none the less), where many had come up with a number of different mounting methods. I decided I could come up with my own variation using a £2 piece of acrylic from eBay and a dremel.

My first attempt is fairly crude compared to some fine examples of home design and build but it does the job for an hour&#8217;s work. If I can get my hands on a 3d printer I have some other designs in mind&#8230;

<figcaption class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-1-48'> The mount is clamped between the stem face plate and body. The groves allow the stem bolts to pass. Not very neat but it won&#8217;t be seen and as a first prototype adjustments were required. </figcaption></figure><figure class='gallery-item'>
