When I first started seeing the Ambilight (Philips&#8217;s lighting system that allows the display to _bleed_ out) clones popping up I knew I wanted to create one myself. The open-source system has been fairly well refined to this point, such that it is pretty much plug and play with Raspbmc (XBMC for the Raspberry Pi). &#8216;nadnerb&#8217; has already created a [tutorial for the process](http://pibob.nadnerb.co.uk/), which I followed, so I won&#8217;t go into the process here. This post is just to share my results.
