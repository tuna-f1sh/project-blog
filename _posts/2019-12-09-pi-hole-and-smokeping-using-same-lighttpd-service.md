I was having random &#8211; or not so random &#8211; internet dropouts on a 4G WiFi router. I wanted to ascertain when they occur and if it&#8217;s internal wireless or WAN to troubleshoot. `smokeping` is an old but useful tool to capture this as it sits in the background constantly pinging pre-defined servers.

Since I had a Pi-Hole on the network, this seemed the best tool. Getting the web-portal up and running requires some tinkering however to run as part of the existing Pi-Hole lighttpd web server.

Turns out the correlation is with trains and rush hour! I live near a train station and as a train comes to the station at peak times, the contention ratio on the 4G mast must go through the roof and my internet crawlsâ€¦Either that or the electric train lines are EMC bandits!

**Warning: Steps below worked on PiHole 4.0 and were captured post-process for my own documentation; it is not a concrete guide and some system knowledge is probably required**

## Install Smokeping

```bash
sudo apt install smokeping
```

## Smokeping Setup With Pihole Lighttpd

```bash
# enable cgi
sudo ln -s /usr/share/smokeping/www /var/www/html/smokeping
sudo cp /var/www/html/smokeping/smokeping.fcgi.dist /var/www/html/smokeping/smokeping.fcgi
echo 'exec /usr/lib/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi /etc/smokeping/config' >> /var/www/html/smokeping/smokeping.fcgi
```

## Setup Fast cgi /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/10-fastcgi.conf

```bash
fastcgi.server += (
  "smokeping.fcgi" => ((
    "socket"   => "/var/run/lighttpd/fcgi.socket",
    "bin-path" => "/usr/share/smokeping/www/smokeping.fcgi"
  ))
)
```

```bash
sudo lighttpd-enable-mod fastcgi
sudo /etc/init.d/lighttpd force-reload
```

## Check Route

<http://localhost/smokeping/smokeping.fcgi>

## Redirect Smokeping Route to Fast cgi File

In _/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf_

```bash
$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/smokeping/" {
         url.redirect  = ("^/smokeping/?$" => "/smokeping/smokeping.fcgi")}
```

Now one can simply navigate to [pihole.local/smokeping](pihole.local/smokeping)
